Password_Generator Description:

### *Password Generator â€“ Skill Application Summary*

In this project, I developed a fully functional *Password Generator* using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal was to create a tool that enables users to generate secure, customizable passwords with options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
This project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, user input handling, and dynamic content generation.

I structured the user interface using semantic HTML, providing an intuitive layout with interactive controls for password customization. 
The styling was crafted with modern CSS techniques, including responsive design principles and a clean, dark-themed UI for improved readability and aesthetic appeal.

On the JavaScript side, I implemented event-driven functionality using the addEventListener method to capture user actions such as form input changes and button clicks. 
I utilized functions to generate random characters from specific ASCII ranges, applying String.fromCharCode() for efficient random letter and number generation, and created a pool of symbols to draw from for added complexity.

The core password generation logic ensures balanced inclusion of all selected character types.
It dynamically constructs the password based on user preferences, while also preventing generation if no options are selected, demonstrating validation and user feedback handling.
I used modular design patterns by separating character generators and encapsulating logic in clean, reusable functions.

Additionally, I integrated clipboard functionality via the *Clipboard API*, allowing users to copy generated passwords with a single click, enhancing usability. 
An alert confirms the copy action, providing immediate feedback.

Through this project, I applied real-world JavaScript skills in user interface interactivity, form control, string manipulation, and responsive design. 
This project is a solid showcase of how I can translate user requirements into an interactive and secure web tool.
